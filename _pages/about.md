I am Junhung Lee, a mathematician.
I belong to [https://educ.titech.ac.jp/math/eng/](Department of Mathematics, Tokyo Institute of Technology) as a [https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/postdoctoral.html](JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow).

My interests is [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), in particular, discrete dynamical systems related to arthimetric sides.
I have done a several work on non-archimedean dynamical systems, and also on applications of ergodic theory to analytic number theory.

I was a [https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/pd_sin.html](JSPS Fellow) from 2016 to 2017, and got my PhD degree in [http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp](Graduate School, Nagoya University) in 2017.
I visited many cities such as [https://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/default_e.jsp](Taipei), [https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/](Rochester), [https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/](Amherst), and [https://www.math.northwestern.edu](Evanstone) for my reseach, and met many nice mathematicians.
After such visiting, I resigned JSPS Fellow because of my military duty, and was staying in Yangjiri, Cheolwon for military duty.

I was working for a [http://www.phdpro.leading.nagoya-u.ac.jp/eng/index.html](leading program) of Nagoya University as a research assistant.
I got my Bachellor and master degree at [http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp](Nagoya University).
