I am **Junghun Lee**, a **mathematician**.
I am currently a [JSPS postdoctoral fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/postdoctoral.html) at [Department of Mathematics, Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/math/eng/).

My research interest is [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), in particular, the arithmetic aspects of discrete dynamical systems.
I have done several work on non-archimedean dynamical systems, in particular, the dynamics on the [Julia sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).
I also have a few works on applications of [ergodic theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theory) in [analytic number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory), in particular, applications to value distribution of [zeta functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function).

I was a [JSPS Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/pd_sin.html) from 2016 to 2017, and received my PhD degree in [Graduate School, Nagoya University](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp) in 2017.
I visited several academic institutions, in [Taipei](https://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/default_e.jsp), [Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/), [Amherst](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/) and [Evanstone](https://www.math.northwestern.edu), and met many nice mathematicians.
However afterwards, I had to resign from JSPS Fellowship due to military duty, and was spending time in Yangjiri, Cheolwon for military duty.

I was also working for a [leading program](http://www.phdpro.leading.nagoya-u.ac.jp/eng/index.html) of Nagoya University as a research assistant.
I got my Bachellor and master degree at [Nagoya University](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp).
