I am Junghun Lee, a mathematician.
I belong to [Department of Mathematics, Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/math/eng/) as a [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/postdoctoral.html).

My reseach interest is [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), in particular, discrete dynamical systems related to arthimetic sides.
I have done a several work on non-archimedean dynamical systems, and also on applications of ergodic theory to analytic number theory.

I was a [JSPS Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/j-pd/pd_sin.html) from 2016 to 2017, and got my PhD degree in [Graduate School, Nagoya University](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp) in 2017.
I visited many institutes in [Taipei](https://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/www/default_e.jsp), [Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/mth/), [Amherst](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/mathematics-statistics/), and [Evanstone](https://www.math.northwestern.edu) for my reseach, and met many nice mathematicians.
After such visiting, I resigned JSPS Fellow because of my military duty, and was spending time in Yangjiri, Cheolwon for military duty.

I was also working for a [leading program](http://www.phdpro.leading.nagoya-u.ac.jp/eng/index.html) of Nagoya University as a research assistant.
I got my Bachellor and master degree at [Nagoya University](http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp).
